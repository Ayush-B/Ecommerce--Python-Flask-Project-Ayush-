# Ecommerce System
This project is a small ecommerce application that I built to learn how a full web system works from backend to frontend. I wanted something that felt real enough to use, but still simple enough that I could understand every piece of it. I chose Flask for the backend, SQLAlchemy with MySQL for the database, and Semantic UI for the frontend because these tools let me focus on the logic rather than a huge framework.

The idea is to create an online store where a user can register with an email and password, log in, browse products, search for items, view categories, add things to a cart, and go through a basic checkout process. The checkout uses an asynchronous function that simulates payment processing, because I wanted to practice using async and await inside a Flask project. Users can also see their past orders and update their shipping information.

I also added an admin dashboard because I wanted to understand how permissions, data changes, and management tasks fit into a real application. The admin can create and edit products, update user accounts, review orders, and change order status. Every time the admin makes a change, the system records it in an activity log so I can see how logging, auditing, and tracking can be handled. There is even a streaming view of the log that uses a generator function, which gave me a chance to experiment with Python’s generator features in a practical situation.

Throughout the project, I tried to weave in as many important Python ideas as I could. There are object-oriented models with inheritance and abstract base classes, list comprehensions used for filtering data, decorators that wrap routes for authentication and admin checks, context managers to handle certain operations safely, and utility modules for datetime handling, price calculations, and logging. The code includes natural comments explaining why each feature is used, the way a student might talk through their own thought process.

In the end, this project helped me understand how all the parts of a web app fit together: the database layer, the application logic, the templates, and the user experience. It is not meant to be a production system, but it works end-to-end and shows how Python tools can be combined to build something complete.
