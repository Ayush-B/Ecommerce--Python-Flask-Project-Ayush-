# Ecommerce--Python-Flask-Project-Ayush-
This is a small ecommerce app I built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, and Semantic UI. It has user login, product browsing, a session cart, checkout with async payment simulation, order history, and an admin panel for managing products, users, and orders. Admin actions are logged and viewable through a generator stream.
